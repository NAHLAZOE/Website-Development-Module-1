            <h2>Facts About North Korea</h2>
            <p>In N.Korea, there are very silly rules that might just send you to prison. Religion is equal to getting persecuted. The channels that citizens view are made in the country. If your child is found watching a channel made from outside the country, both of you are finished. Visitors coming into and out of the country get their phones checked. Some worldwide travellers like Nas Daily have confessed to cry seeing the difference between them and their twin, South Korea. At night from space, literally at the border, one can see one side full of lights while the other side is complete darkness. How much I pity the citizens of that country! </p>

            <p>NB:The president of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, is known for being one of the second most cruel dictator to live after Uganda's Idi Amin Dada. Kim Jong Un made a rule in the country that being no citizen has the right to buy any car imported into the country. That's why highways there are mostly clear with few cars.</p>
