    <h1>Our Lady of Mount Carmel Maryhill Girls High School</h1>

      Maryhill Girls is located along the <b>Thika-Mang'u Highway</b>. it is one of <mark>the best performing national schools in Kenya.</mark> Maryhill was founded by the White Sisters in <em>1933.</em> Great women have studied from this prestigious school. A good example is the former Cabinet Secretary of Health <u>Dr. Susan Nakumicha.</u>  <br>
          <br>
          The current principle of Maryhill is Madam Ngure. She is very nice. We have <strong>three deputy principles</strong> due to our high population of <strong>more than three thousand students.</strong> We have a total of <u>17 subjects learnt</u> in the school. My favourite subjects are Biology, Chemistry and Physics. In my school, Form Ones have the largest populatin of <i>882</i>. Teachers in my school teach us very well and are very hardworking too.
